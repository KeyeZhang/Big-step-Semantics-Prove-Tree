<p>
  A ball with mass $m ={{params.m}}\rm\ kg$ is thrown downward from the top of a building with height $h = {{params.h}}\rm\ m$ and initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal as shown in the figure. The $x$-component of the initial velocity $v_{x0} = {{params.v0x}}\rm\ m/s$, and the ball hits the ground a distance $d = {{params.d}}\rm\ m$ from the building as shown in the figure.
