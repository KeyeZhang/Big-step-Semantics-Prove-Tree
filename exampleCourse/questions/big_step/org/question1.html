This sample allows a user to make progressive decisions about personality types.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of nodes, so there are two node templates ("decision" and "personality")
that determine the appearance and behavior of each <a>Node</a>.
</p>
<p>
The "decision" template displays the abbreviated personality type and two choice buttons, all surrounded by a figure.
Clicking a button will either expand the choice or will collapse all nodes leading from that choice.
</p>
<p>
The "personality" template displays the personality descriptions, as the "leaf" nodes for the tree.
